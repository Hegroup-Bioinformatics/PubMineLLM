# PubMineLLM

Primarily developed by Matt Asato in He Lab, PubMineLLM takes inputs of PMIDs in csv, space seperated, or manual inputs. 
This program can work with any CSV format. You just provide any CSV header column names, and our program will output information from individual papers for you.

We have tested our program in the vaccine domain. Specifically, our test program outputs a vaccine csv with fields:
- pmcid
- vaccine_name
- vaccine_target_pathogen 
- vaccine_target_host
- vaccine_model_host 
- vaccine_delivery_method
- vaccine_manufacturer 
- vaccine_storage_method
- vaccine_stage 
- vaccine_license 
- vaccine_antigen 
- vaccine_formulation 

The program utilizes LLMs to parse and read full-legnth papers and retrieves the specific fields. Note that internally the program is called "PaperToData".

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: 
```bash 
> git clone https://github.com/Hegroup-Bioinformatics/PaperToData.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Setup .env files:  

	- langchain.env 
	- llm.env

	Make sure that the fields are encapsulated as strings:
	```cpp
	FIELD_NAME="value_here"
	```

	### langchain.env
	```cpp
	LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT={YOUR_ENDPOINT}
	LANGCHAIN_TRACING="true" 			//default is true
	LANGCHAIN_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}
	```
	### llm.env
	```cpp
	DEPLOYMENT={MODEL_NAME} 			// gpt-4o-mini is good
	API_VERSION={VERSION} 				// 2024-06-01 is good
	API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}
	ENDPOINT={YOUR_ENDPOINT}
	ORGANIZATION={YOUR_ORGANIZATION} 
	```

## Usage
To run the program:
```cpp
> python3 ./mainCSV.py     		
```
If python3 does not work:
```cpp
> python ./mainCSV.py
```
When running the program you will be prompted to enter a file for the output csv in the data folder. Then you will choose an input method, and lastly, a input file location if you choose csv or space seperated.  
Your file structure should look like this:
```cpp
PaperToData/
	data/
	  └──data.csv					 //must be csv
	pmid_input/
		└──input.csv         //for space seperated, can be txt
```
PaperToData makes a folder for raw_xml, storing all retrieved articles, it is not necessary to keep them after program runs but is helpful for debugging.

## Example 
In this example we will use PudMed to retrieve 100 PMIDs for articles related to covid-19 vaccine.
Pressing display options can enable you to select the number per page as well as format. Select PMID in the dropdown menu.

After you should get this:

Copy these values and put them into a txt in the pmid_input folder.
Make sure that there is a valid csv in the data folder.

Run the program:
```cpp
	> python3 ./mainCSV.py
	Welcome to Paper to Neo4j
	Model Loaded 

	Langchain Loaded 
	Enter a csv in data folder
	> test.csv
	Choose input method: csv, space sperated values, manual input, enter c, s, or m
	> s
	Enter the name of the file in pmid input folder
	> input.txt
```


After the program starts running, you should see a stream of data in the terminal. You can see the entries being made in real time in your output file.
